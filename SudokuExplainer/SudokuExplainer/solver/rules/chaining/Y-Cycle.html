  <h2>XY-Cycle</h2>
  <p>
   The cells <c><b>{0}</b></c> form a XY-Cycle: there are exactly two ways
   of placing the <b>values</b> in these cells, forming two different possible
   configurations. Some <b>values</b> appear in a row, column or block regardless of the
   chosen configuration. Because one of the two configurations must be correct, <b>other
   occurances of these values</b> can be removed from these rows, columns or blocks.
  </p>
  <p>
   The cycle is an XY-Cycle because only cells with two potential values are involved.
   XY-Cycles are also known as Forcing Loops or Bivalue cycles.
  </p>
  <p>
   The two configurations of the XY-Cycle are enforced by two complementary,
   circular chains of implications. The details of each chain are given below.
