  <h2>Continuous Nice Loop</h2>
  <p>
   The cells <b>{0}</b> form a Continuous Nice Loop: there are exactly two ways
   of placing the <b>values</b> in these cells, forming two different possible
   configurations. Some <b>values</b> appear in a row, column or block regardless of the
   chosen configuration. Because one of the two configurations must be correct, <b>other
   occurances of these values</b> can be removed from these rows, columns or blocks.
  </p>
  <p>
   The two configurations of the Continuous Nice Loop are enforced by two complementary,
   circular chains of implications. The details of each chain are given below.
