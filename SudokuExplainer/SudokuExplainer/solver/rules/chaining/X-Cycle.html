  <h2>Fishy Cycle {2}</h2>
  <p>
   The cells <b>{0}</b> form a bidirectional cycle: there are exactly two ways
   of placing the <b>value {1}</b> in these cells, forming two different possible
   configurations. Some <b>{1}</b> appear in a row, column or block regardless of the
   chosen configuration. Because one of the two configurations must be correct, <b>other
   occurances of the value {1}</b> can be removed from these rows, columns or blocks.
  </p>
  <p>
   The cycle is an X-Cycle because only a single value is involved. Fishy Cycles
   are also known as Fishy Cycles or Bi-location cycles.
  </p>
  <p>
   The two configurations of the bidirectional cycle are enforced by two complementary,
   circular chains of implications. The details of each chain are given below.
