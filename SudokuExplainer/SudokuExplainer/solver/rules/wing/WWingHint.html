		<h2>W-Wing</h2>

			The two <b>cells {2} and {3}</b> have a strong link on <b>digit {5}</b>
			(the <i>x</i> value).
		</p>
		<p>
			A strong link between 2 candidates exists if at least one of them must be true.<br>
			In this case the link is strong because the two cells are the only cells in
			<b>{6}</b> containing the <b>candidate {5}</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			If one of the <b>cells {2} or {3}</b> must be a <b>digit {5}</b> then either
			<b>cell {0}</b> or <b>cell {1}</b> cannot be a <b>digit {5}</b> but must
			contain a <b>digit {4}</b> (the <i>w</i> value).
		</p>
		<p>
			None of the cells seen by these two cells can therefore contain
			<b>digit {4}</b> as a candidate.
