  <h2>XY-Wing</h2>
  <p>
   The three cells <b>{0}</b>, <b>{1}</b> and <b>{2}</b> form an <b>XY-Wing</b>
   pattern on the value <b>{3}</b>.
   Regardless of the correct value of the cell <b>{0}</b> (<b>{4}</b> or
   <b>{5}</b>), one of the two cells <b>{1}</b> or <b>{2}</b> will
   have the value <b>{3}</b> as its only remaining possible value.
   It follows that either the cell <b>{1}</b> or the cell <b>{2}</b> must
   contain the value <b>{3}</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other occurances of the <b>value {3}</b> can therefore be removed from any
   cells sharing a row, column or block with both <b>{1}</b> and <b>{2}</b>.
