  <h2>{0}</h2>
  <p>
   All the potential positions of the value <b>{1}</b> in {2} different
   <b>{3}s</b> are in the same {2} <b>{4}s</b>. Because the number of
   <b>{3}s</b> matches the number of  <b>{4}s</b>, and because each
   <b>{3}</b> must contain the value <b>{1}</b>; each
   <b>{4}</b> will have a <b>{1}</b> in one of the intersecting cells.
  </p>
  <p>
   The other potential positions of the value <b>{1}</b> that are in the
   <b>{4}s</b> but not in one of the <b>{3}s</b> can therefore be removed.
