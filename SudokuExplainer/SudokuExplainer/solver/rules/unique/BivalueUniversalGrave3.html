  <h2>BUG with Subsets (Type 3, with Naked {4})</h2>
  <p>
   If the <b>values {0}</b> were removed from the <b>cells {1}</b>, the
   Sudoku would exhibit a <b>Bivalue Universal Grave</b> pattern (or <b>BUG</b>).
  </p>
  <p>
   In a BUG, each value that remains in a row, column or block has exactly two
   possible positions in that row, column or block; and each empty cell has exactly two
   possible values. A Sudoku having a BUG has <i><b>zero, two or more</b></i> valid
   solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Because a valid Sudoku has exactly one solution, the BUG cannot be part of it.
   The only way to avoid the BUG is if at least one of the <b>cells {2}</b>
   contains one of the <b>values {3}</b>. It follows that one of <b>{2}</b>
   forms a <b>Naked {4}</b> with <b>{5}</b> on the values <b>{6}</b> in the
   <b>{7}</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other potential positions of the values <b>{6}</b> can therefore be removed
   from the <b>{7}</b>.
