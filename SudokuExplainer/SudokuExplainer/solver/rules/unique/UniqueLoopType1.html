  <h2>Unique {0} Standard Type (Type 1)</h2>
  <p>
   The cells <b>{3}</b> form a <b>Unique {0}</b> with the values
   <b>{1}</b> and <b>{2}</b>. There are exactly two ways of placing
   the values <b>{1}</b> and <b>{2}</b> in the <b>cells</b> of the
   Unique {0}, forming two possible configurations.
   In both configurations, each row, column or block touched by the Unique
   {0} contains each of the two values <b>{1}</b> and <b>{2}</b>
   exactly once. As a result, if one of these two configurations were part of the
   solution, it could then be replaced by the other one to get a <i>second valid
   solution</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
   Because a valid sudoku cannot have more than one solution, none of the two
   configurations of the Unique {0} can be valid. The only possible way to avoid these
   two configurations is if the cell <b>{4}</b> does not contain the values
   <b>{1}</b> and <b>{2}</b>.
