  <h2>Aligned {0} Exclusion</h2>
  <p>
   The <b>cells {1}</b> can together accept various combinations of values. But
   some combinations of values can be excluded, because they would leave some cells with
   no possible values.
  </p>
  <p>
   More precisely, the following combinations of values are not possible for the
   <b>cells {1}</b>:<br>
   {2}
  </p>
  <p>
   Because the value <b>{4}</b> of the <b>cell {3}</b> occurs in none of
   the remaining combinations, it can safely be removed.
