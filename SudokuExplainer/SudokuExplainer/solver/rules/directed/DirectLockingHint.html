  <h2>{3}</h2>
  <p>
   All the potential positions of the value <b>{0}</b> in the
   <b>{1}</b> are in the same <b>{2}</b>.
   Because the <b>{1}</b> must contain the value {0}, the <b>{2}</b> will have the
   value {0} in one of the intersecting cells.
  </p>
  <p>
   The other potential positions of the value <b>{0}</b> that are in the
   <b>{2}</b> but not in the <b>{1}</b> are therefore not valid.
  </p>
  <p>
   As a result, the <b>cell {4}</b> is the only remaining position of
   the value <b>{0}</b> in its <b>{1}</b>.
